- **Ticket Booking**: Allows users to search for events, view details, and book tickets.  
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can oversee event management, monitor bookings, and generate reports.  
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI for optimal usability on both desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Payment Integration**: Support for secure online payment gateways (if implemented).  
- **Email Notifications**: Automated email notifications for booking confirmations and updates.
